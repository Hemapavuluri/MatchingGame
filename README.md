# MatchingGame
This is a simple app written using HTML and Javascript.
The game is deisgned in such a way that it has two panels. The smileys are made to be generated randomly with one extra smiley on the left panel.
The extra one should be identified and clicked on for the game to continue further.
If the wrong one is chosen. The game ends!
